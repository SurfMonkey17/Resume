    <p>Hi! I'm Sherry Fisher. I live in Cheyenne, WY with my husband and son. We are a homeschooling family with a passion for learning and experiencing new things. When I am not at my computer working or studying, I enjoy taking time to pursue my hobbies, which include VR gaming, archery, golfing, or hiking with my pup, Loki, a crazy and rambunctious bull terrier. My days off are often spent outdoors hiking or fishing with my family. </p>

    <p>I have always had a passion for tech and now that my son is graduating high school, I finally have the time to pursue my dream of working in the tech field. I love that there is always something new to learn and opportunities grow within the field.</p>
